# React Native Testing

{: .no_toc }

Testing is very important for any software, including mobile apps. During the app's lifecycle, we have to fix bugs, implement new features, modify the existing features due to business changes so the codebase go bigger everyday. To ensure our app is working properly before release it, we need to do testing.

There are various testing types. To get started, we should only focus on the kinds of testing that make sense:

**Unit testing**: Developers should write unit tests for their own code to test functions, units.

**Integration testing**: Integration testing is often done in concert with unit testing. Integration testing ensures app's components operate and communicate together seamlessly.

**User interaction testing**: This includes testing of UI controls like buttons, menus and text input to ensure that the experience flow and features chosen are optimal for the user experience.
